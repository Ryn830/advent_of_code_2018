  * For example, if you see the following box IDs:
  *    abcdef contains no letters that appear exactly two or three times.
  *    bababc contains two a and three b, so it counts for both.
  *    abbcde contains two b, but no letter appears exactly three times.
  *    abcccd contains three c, but no letter appears exactly two times.
  *    aabcdd contains two a and two d, but it only counts once.
  *    abcdee contains two e.
  *    ababab contains three a and three b, but it only counts once.
  * Of these box IDs, four of them contain a letter which appears exactly twice,
  * and three of them contain a letter which appears exactly three times.
  * Multiplying these together produces a checksum of 4 * 3 = 12.
  *
  * What is the checksum for your list of box IDs?

/**
  * Confident that your list of box IDs is complete, you're ready to find the boxes full of prototype fabric.
  * The boxes will have IDs which differ by exactly one character at the same position in both strings.

  *    abcde
  *    fghij
  *    klmno
  *    pqrst
  *    fguij
  *    axcye
  *    wvxyz
  * The IDs abcde and axcye are close, but they differ by two characters (the second and fourth).
  * However, the IDs fghij and fguij differ by exactly one character, the third (h and u).
  * Those must be the correct boxes.
  * What letters are common between the two correct box IDs? (In the example above, this is found
  * by removing the differing character from either ID, producing fgij.)
